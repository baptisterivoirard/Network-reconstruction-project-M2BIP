# Network-reconstruction-project-M2BIP
Network reconstruction project completed as part of a course in my master's program.
This project consisted to choose a dataset and use different network reconstruction methods (ARACNE, MIIC...) to analyse the interactions between the clinical and non clinical variables.
The choice of the dataset is explained in the Data Proposal_shortv1 file
The R script for the features selection and network reconstruction is script_RESYS.R
The original dataset is METABRIC_RNA_Mutation.csv
